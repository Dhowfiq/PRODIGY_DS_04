# PRODIGY_DS_04
Project Overview:

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis techniques on social media data using Power BI. It involves:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Loading the social media data (e.g., tweets) into Power BI and performing basic cleaning tasks.
Sentiment Analysis: Implementing sentiment analysis techniques (e.g., using Power Query or custom columns) to classify the data as positive, negative, or neutral.
Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations (e.g., bar charts, sentiment timelines) to understand public sentiment towards specific topics or brands.
Requirements:

Microsoft Power BI Desktop (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
Instructions:

Download and install Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
Open twitter_training.csv (or your data file) in Power BI Desktop.
Follow the logic in the provided Power Query scripts (or custom columns) to clean and perform sentiment analysis on the data.
Create visualizations to explore sentiment patterns and public opinion.
Note:

This is a basic framework. You might need to modify the data cleaning and sentiment analysis steps depending on your specific data format and chosen techniques.
Consider including comments within the Power Query Editor (or custom column formulas) to explain the logic behind each step.
This project provides a starting point for sentiment analysis in Power BI. Feel free to explore more advanced techniques and visualizations to gain deeper insights from your social media data.
